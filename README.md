This is a little wrapper function that provides LGAs based on given states


##Usage
This is quite simple, by the way. Simply call the function fetchLGA() which takes two parameters => state (string) and returns an array containing the LGAs inside of that given state as an array

##Example:
```js
  fetchLGA('Akwa Ibom');
```
 That will simply return array=> ['Ikot Ekpene', ...]
